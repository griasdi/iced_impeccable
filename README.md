Headless remote control for [iced](https://iced.rs) 0.14 applications and
daemons, built for coding agents that need to see and operate the UI they
change, plus a companion skill that brings the
[impeccable](https://impeccable.style) design workflow to iced desktop apps.

The app runs offscreen with its real renderer behind a local control socket
(a named pipe on Windows). A client sends one command per connection: input,
widget lookups by id or text, waits, screenshots. The app's own tasks and
subscriptions run unchanged; no window, display server or desktop input is
involved.

![The demo app, captured headless with screenshot --annotate: every widget the interface reports is outlined and numbered, matching the node lines of tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuco86/iced_impeccable/main/assets/demo-annotated.png)

*The demo app captured with `screenshot --annotate`: the numbers match the
node lines `tree` prints, so an agent clicks `tap #settings` or
`tap --nth 2 Save` instead of guessing coordinates.*

## Install

```sh
cargo install iced_impeccable --bin iced-impeccable --locked
```

The `iced-impeccable` binary:

- `ctl`: the client, the same as `<app> ctl` ([Run](#run));
- `sheet`: contact sheets from screenshots ([Contact sheets](#contact-sheets));
- `install`: the skill into a repository ([Skill](#skill));
- `help`: the protocol, offline.

## Integrate

```toml
[dependencies]
iced_impeccable = { version = "0.2", optional = true }

[features]
remote = ["dep:iced_impeccable"]
```

```rust
fn main() -> iced::Result {
    let app = iced::application(App::new, App::update, App::view)
        .subscription(App::subscription);

    #[cfg(feature = "remote")]
    return iced_impeccable::Remote::new(app)
        // periodic messages that mean "time passed", not activity
        .heartbeat(|m| matches!(m, Message::Tick(_) | Message::Frame(_)))
        // app-specific commands, e.g. `ctl <socket> reset`
        .command("reset", "clear the form", |_| Ok(Message::Reset))
        .run();

    #[cfg(not(feature = "remote"))]
    app.run()
}
```

- Icon-only interactive widgets get an id: `container(button(icon)).id("settings")`.
- Code that parses argv uses `iced_impeccable::app_args()` (argv without the host flags).
- Code that must not open OS dialogs checks `iced_impeccable::is_headless()`.
- Desktop integration that must not run headless (tray icons) goes into
  `.windowed(|| ...)`, headless-only setup into `.headless(|| ...)`.
- A daemon (`iced::daemon(...)`) is wrapped the same way: `Remote::new(daemon)`.
- Release builds never enable `remote`.

## Run

```sh
cargo build --features remote
target/debug/myapp --headless --control /tmp/myapp-1.sock [--size 1280x800] [--scale 2] \
    [--appearance dark|light] [--backend wgpu|tiny-skia] 2>/tmp/myapp-1.log &
target/debug/myapp ctl /tmp/myapp-1.sock info          # or: iced-impeccable ctl ...
iced-impeccable ctl /tmp/myapp-1.sock - <<'EOF'         # batch: one command per line
tree
tap #name
type Ada
tap --nth 2 Save
wait-for Saved Ada
wait-idle
screenshot --annotate shots/form.png
quit
EOF
```

`ctl [--wait MS] [--keep-going] [--window N] <socket> <command...>` retries
the connection for up to 5 s (no sleep after starting the host), prints the
reply and exits 0 on `ok`, 1 on `err`, 2 on bad usage. With `-` it reads a
batch from stdin (blank lines and `#` comments skipped) and stops at the
first `err` unless `--keep-going`.

A host started with a plain `&` belongs to the shell that started it. Tools
that run each command in a fresh shell (agent harnesses) kill it when that
command returns: start it as a background job of the harness, with
`setsid ... &`, or drive it in the same command line.

`--backend tiny-skia` renders on the CPU and needs no GPU (CI uses it);
`wgpu`, the default, shows the real GPU pipelines in screenshots.

## Protocol

One request line per connection; the reply is everything the host writes
until it closes the connection. The first line starts with `ok` or `err`,
further lines are payload. Coordinates are UI-logical pixels; a PNG pixel is
a logical pixel times the scale.

| Command | Reply |
|---|---|
| `help` | `ok` + one line per command, targets, keys, coordinates, custom commands |
| `info` | `ok pid P app NAME size WxH scale S appearance dark\|light backend NAME windows N` |
| `windows` | `ok N` + one `INDEX WxH scale S title="TITLE"` line per open window |
| `size` | `ok W H SCALE` |
| `move X Y [MS]`, `down [BUTTON]`, `up [BUTTON]`, `click X Y [BUTTON] [MODS]`, `dblclick X Y`, `drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2 [STEPS] [MS]` | `ok` |
| `scroll X Y DY [DX]` | `ok`; wheel lines, DY>0 scrolls up, DY<0 scrolls down |
| `key SPEC`, `keydown SPEC`, `keyup SPEC`, `type [-e] TEXT` | `ok`; `-e`: `\n` Enter, `\t` Tab, `\\` backslash |
| `tap [--nth N] TARGET` | `ok X Y` (clicked point) |
| `hover [--nth N] TARGET` | `ok X Y` (the pointer moved to the widget's centre) |
| `find [--nth N] TARGET` | `ok X Y W H` (visible bounds) |
| `find-all TARGET` | `ok N` + one `X Y W H` line per match (` hidden` when scrolled away) |
| `focused` | `ok X Y W H` or `err none` |
| `tree [--all]` | `ok N` + node lines |
| `wait-for [--timeout MS] TARGET` | `ok X Y W H` or `err timeout` (default 5000) |
| `wait-gone [--timeout MS] TARGET` | `ok` or `err timeout` (default 5000) |
| `wait-idle [--timeout MS] [MS]` | `ok idle`, `ok animating` or `err timeout` (quiet MS default 200, timeout default 10000) |
| `screenshot [--annotate] [--no-pointer] [--crop X Y W H] [--zoom N] PATH` | `ok PATH WxH scale S` (+ node lines with `--annotate`; `--no-pointer`: no hover state) |
| `record PATH`, `record-stop` | `ok recording PATH WxH`, `ok PATH N frames Ts` (needs ffmpeg) |
| `resize W H` | `ok W H` (clamped to the window's min/max size) |
| `scale F` | `ok` |
| `appearance dark\|light` | `ok` |
| `clip`, `clip-set [-e] TEXT` | `ok TEXT`, `ok` |
| `drop PATH` | `ok`; FileHovered then FileDropped |
| `quit` | `ok`, or `ok forced` when the app ignored the close request for 5 s |
| `<custom> [ARGS]` | `ok`, `err NAME: ...`, or `err unknown command "NAME" (see help)` |

**Several windows**: a daemon, or an app that opens more windows, has several
pretend windows, numbered from 1 in opening order (`windows` lists them). A
command addresses the oldest open window unless its line starts with `@N `:
`@2 tap Close`, `@2 screenshot second.png`. `ctl --window N` prefixes `@N `
to every line without one. A missing window answers
`err no window N (open: 1..M, see windows)` or `err no window open`. `help`,
`windows`, `clip`, `clip-set`, `appearance`, `wait-idle`, `record-stop`,
`quit` and custom commands ignore the selector. When a window closes,
`wait-gone` on it answers `ok`, `wait-for` `err window closed`, and its
recording ends. `quit` delivers the close request to the oldest window that
handles close requests itself; a daemon exits only through `iced::exit`.

**Targets**: `#ID` (widget id), `~SUBSTRING` (text contains), `=TEXT` (exact
text, even when it starts with `#`, `~` or `=`), otherwise exact
text. `--nth N` picks the Nth match (1-based, tree order). Errors say what to
do next: `err not found: Sav; similar: "Save", "Saved Ada"`,
`err ambiguous: 2 matches (use --nth): ...`,
`err not visible: X Y W H (scroll it into view)`.

**Node lines**: `{idx} {kind} at {cx},{cy} box {x} {y} {w} {h}`, then
optionally ` id=ID`, ` focused`, ` hidden`, ` offset X,Y content WxH`
(scrollable), ` text="..."`. Kinds: `text`, `input`, `focusable`,
`scrollable`, `container`, `custom`. Anonymous containers with content are
left out unless `--all`.

**Keys**: one character, a name (`enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `left`, `pgdn`, `f5`,
...), or `code:<Name>` for a physical key; modifiers `ctrl+`, `shift+`,
`alt+`, `super+` in any order.

**`wait-idle`**: `ok idle` after MS without non-heartbeat activity and with no
frame pending; `ok animating` when only redraws kept it busy for another
second (a valid capture of a continuously animating UI, a finding at rest);
`err timeout` after 10 s of real activity.

## Contact sheets

```sh
iced-impeccable sheet [--cols N] [--labels a,b,c] [--max-width PX] OUT.png IN.png...
```

Lays screenshots out in a labelled grid; images wider than a cell are shrunk
to it until the sheet fits `--max-width` (default 2560).

## Skill

The `iced-impeccable` skill (in `plugin/`) layers iced platform guidance and
headless verification on top of the [impeccable](https://impeccable.style)
skill, which must be installed as well.

Recommended, per repository:

```sh
iced-impeccable install [--agent claude,omp] [--yes] [DIR]
```

- Finds the git repository containing `DIR` (default `.`).
- Checks whether the marketplace plugin `iced-impeccable@iced-impeccable` is
  installed for Claude Code or omp; it would load next to the repo copy, so
  `install` offers to remove it (`--yes` removes without asking) and aborts
  otherwise.
- Asks for the agents, with the detected ones preselected; `--agent` skips
  the question and is required without a terminal.
- Writes `.claude/skills/iced-impeccable/` and `.omp/skills/iced-impeccable/`.
- Run again after upgrading the binary, it updates the copy; a symlinked
  skill directory is left alone.

Whether to commit the copies is the repository's choice.

Alternative, global through the marketplace. The two ways exclude each other.

Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add tuco86/iced_impeccable
/plugin install iced-impeccable@iced-impeccable
```

[omp](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), from a clone:

```sh
omp plugin marketplace add /path/to/iced_impeccable
omp plugin install iced-impeccable@iced-impeccable
```
